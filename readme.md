# Ark Nova card decks inserts

This repository contains the source code in OpenSCAD language and STL files with the inserts for the card decks of the board game [ArkNova](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/342942/ark-nova). There are 4 types of inserts: for final score cards, for conservation project cards, for action cards, and for zoo cards. For the latter cards, it's necessary to print 2 inserts, as the deck is quite tall. The inserts have been designed to be used with unsleeved cards. The placement of the inserts is shown in the following images:
